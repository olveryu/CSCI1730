## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, it is easy to read the file 
and display in the ncurse, but the hard part is the scolling
I look at the example online and study then implement in my
code, but I still do not understand the element in  prefreash.
I will cotinune to study ncurse because it is very cool. I like it.
