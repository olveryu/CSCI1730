## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, first I was thinking
about is there a function call repl so we can use it.
I figure out it is a infnity loop to promt user for input.
The hardest part for this lab is the split the process
then split the argv for each process. For echo, we need to put
all the argv together as one argv, I think when we are 
doing the project 3, we should consider different situration
some command can accept more than one argument that seperate
by space.
