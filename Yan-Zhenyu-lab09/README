## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, i think this lab
is very short and very easy because there is sample
code in the man 2 stat page, but acctually it takes
a long time to finish because we need to set up all
the condition if of the set ID. the upper and lower
case S and T takes a long time to code. Overall this
lab is not hard, but just comsume time.
