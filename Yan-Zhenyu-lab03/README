## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

To compile my code, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./exclusive
$ ./primesum
$ ./armstrong
$ ./bitsum
$ ./endtime
```

## Reflection

compared to my initial brainstormï¼Œexclusive.cpp just use X OR to find 
the exclusive number.for Prime sum.cpp, we need to think a algorithm to
calculate it faster, we can use sqrt() to reudce the run time for the
first 100000 prime number sum. for armstrong number, we can use % 10 
and /10 to get the first digit of the number, then we can calculate to
determine it is a armstrong number or not. for bitsum, I use mask and 
couter ++ when it appear a "1" on the binary format. for endtime.cpp
we just use %100 and /100 similiar to the armstrong number to get the
hour and minutes, then add them up together and convert to the correct
time.
