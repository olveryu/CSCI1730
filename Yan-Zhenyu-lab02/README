To compile my code, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./stat
$ ./minmax
$ ./number
$ ./degree
$ ./time
```

## Reflection

compared to my initial brainstormï¼Œdegree.cpp and time.cpp are easy
just takes user's input and use method to get the result; 
however in stat.cpp and minmax.cpp, we need to use stringstream to 
obtain the number in the string which seperated by space. I need to use
a while loop (stream >> number) to read all the information until reach
to the end, otherwise, it won't stop reading.
for number.cpp,the oct,dec and hex format is easy, but the binary format
I need to separated by space every 4 bit, and I need to use "mask", at the
end just print out the message
