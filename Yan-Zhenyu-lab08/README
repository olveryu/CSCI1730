## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, I was so confuse at
the begining because I do not know how to use read(2)
and write(2) at all, after I look at the man page by 
using man 2 read, and man 2 write, I found out I need
to include different header. Also for the STDOUT_FILENO
I also need another header too. In this lab, I use the sterror
to show the error. it is just like the try catch in java, that 
is fun.
