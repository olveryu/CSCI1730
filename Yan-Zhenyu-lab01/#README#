## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, it is much difficult
than i through, we need to use left shift and right
shift to make store the number in the certain position
but there is a problem when I store. When I store a number
in the same position, it does not work. for example, like I
store 1(0001) in position 0, and store 2(0010) in position 0
again, it will come up 3(0011) in the result. I have to clean
up all the value in the position without drupting the other
value, basically just use the left and right shift to clear it
but just need to think a formular for that.
