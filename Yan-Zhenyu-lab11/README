## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm, I thought this lab
should be very easy and similar to the rm function ,
however, the copy directory stucks me more than 3 hours
because I tried to use const * char for the fileName
and because it is a pointer, the value keep change 
and mess a lot of stuff. The second hard part is the copy
the file with the same mode as the only file. At the begining
I use fopen, but it does not have a paramemter with mode, so
I changed to use open.
